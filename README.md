# musicPage
The project has been developed by Raúl Sigüenza Sánchez and is about a web music player.
Its made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a react framework for production websites. 
I have used [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styles and [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/) 
for the icons, so there is practically no css in the whole web, which makes everything easier and cleaner. 
For the structure of the components I have tried to use [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/), I have also made use of [Redux](https://es.redux.js.org/) for state handling.
## Getting Started

First, install all the packages:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
